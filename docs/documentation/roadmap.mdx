This page aims to provide an overview status of where we stand in regards to our current challenges, weaknesses, and our roadmap.

## Challenges
* Create machine learning models that perform well on all collections and NFTs
* Handling various data sources and bringing them together to create insights into the market
  * Especially off-chain data such as current NFT prices (For accurate floor data)

## Weaknesses
* Lack of support for ERC-1155 NFTs
* Limited number of supported collections
* In-house (vs. crowdsourced) machine learning models
* Recognition of sales only from OpenSea marketplace

## Roadmap

### Ongoing
* Improve accuracy of floor-related data for historic and live values
* Continuously iterate on our NFTi valuation models to further improve their reliability

### Next
* Add support for ERC-1155 NFTs
* Add support for marketplaces beyong OpenSea
* Increase NFT collection coverage
* Add direct support for NFTs sold for ERC-20 tokens (Instead of just converting them to equivalent ETH value)
* Investigate more complex machine learning models as well as offering a paltform for crowdsourcing optimal models

### On the Horizon
* Add support for NFTs on other L1 chains (e.g. Solana)
* Bring collection-like analytics and insights for wallets
